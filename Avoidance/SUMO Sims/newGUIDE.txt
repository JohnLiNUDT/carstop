run old-style simulations:
"python runSims.py n" runs the simulation specified in runSim.py for n times and stores the output in the Results folder.

run new-style simulations:
"python [your simulation].py -i n" runs the simulation of choice n times.
Or you can run it in Spyder, and set the number of iterations (as well as the output name) there.

To get sensor data:
applySensor

To use both and find real/predicted collisions:
applyPredictor
